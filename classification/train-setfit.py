"""
Few-shot text classification with SetFit — train on 8-64 labelled examples per class, on CPU.

SetFit fine-tunes a sentence-transformer body with contrastive pairs, then fits a logistic
regression head on the embeddings. With a handful of examples per class it reaches a useful
classifier in minutes without a GPU, which makes it the cheap middle rung between zero-shot
LLM labelling and a full encoder fine-tune (`train-classifier.py`).

Run on HF Jobs (cpu-basic is enough; no GPU needed):

    hf jobs uv run --flavor cpu-basic --secrets HF_TOKEN \\
        https://huggingface.co/datasets/uv-scripts/classification/raw/main/train-setfit.py \\
        fancyzhx/ag_news username/ag-news-setfit \\
        --num-samples 8

Metrics match `train-classifier.py` (accuracy + macro F1 on a held-out split) so the two are
directly comparable at equal eval settings.

NOTE: a SetFit model is a sentence-transformer body plus a scikit-learn head. It loads with
`SetFitModel.from_pretrained(repo)`, NOT `AutoModelForSequenceClassification`.
