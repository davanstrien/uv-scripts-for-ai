"""How often do you take your coding agent's recommendation?

Claude Code can pause mid-task and ask you a multiple-choice question (the
AskUserQuestion tool), often marking one option "(Recommended)". This script
scans your local Claude Code logs and reports how often you picked the
recommended option when one was offered.

Runs on your own machine over ~/.claude/projects — no Hub, no GPU, no network.
Read-only; the default output is aggregate counts only.

Specific to Claude Code logs (the AskUserQuestion tool + ~/.claude/projects
JSONL format). Other coding agents record sessions differently.

Run it (nothing to install but uv):
    uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davanstrien/uv-scripts-for-ai/main/agent-traces/claude-code-agree-rate.py
    uv run claude-code-agree-rate.py --examples 20      # show each answered case
    uv run claude-code-agree-rate.py --json             # machine-readable
    uv run claude-code-agree-rate.py --path ~/some/dir  # scan a different log dir

Privacy: --examples prints the text of your questions and answers, which can
include private project details. The default (aggregate) output is safe to
share; --examples output is not.
